🛒 Welcome to the Interactive Grocery Store! 🥑🍞🥛

This project simulates a simple interactive grocery store where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and checkout

## What's in Our Store? 🏪

Our code pantry is stocked with these Java goodies:

1. `Main.java`: The grand entrance to our store
2. `Store.java`: Where we keep all our digital products
3. `Product.java`: The blueprint for our awesome items
4. `ShoppingCart.java`: Your virtual basket
5. `Order.java`: The receipt for your shopping spree
6. `UserInputHandler.java`: Your personal shopping assistant

## Cool Things You Can Do 🛍️

- Window shop through our products
- Toss items into your cart
- Have second thoughts? No problem! Remove items easily
- Peek into your cart anytime
- Ready to go? Check out and see your total

## Let's Go Shopping! 🚀

1. Make sure you've got Java installed on your computer (it's like having a grocery store membership card).
2. Open up your terminal (think of it as the store's entrance).
3. Compile our code (it's like turning on the store lights):
   ```
   javac *.java
   ```
4. Start shopping!
   ```
   java Main
   ```

## How to Shop 🛍️

Once you're in, you'll see a menu that looks something like this:

1. View Products (window shopping, anyone?)
2. Add Product to Cart (found something you like?)
3. View Cart (making sure you didn't forget the milk)
4. Remove Product from Cart (changed your mind about those extra cookies?)
5. Checkout (time to pay up!)
6. Exit (thanks for visiting!)

Just type in the number of what you want to do, and hit enter. Easy peasy!

## Meet Your Shopping Assistant 🤖

Say hello to `UserInputHandler`! This handy class is like your personal shopping buddy. It'll show you around the store, help you pick out items, and even handle the checkout process. No need to flag down a store employee – this digital assistant has got your back!

## Future Store Upgrades 🚀

We've got big plans for our little store! Here's what we're thinking:

- Remember your favorite items for next time
- Let you create a shopping account (VIP status, anyone?)
- Give the store a fancy makeover with graphics
- Add a search function (for when you just can't find the pasta aisle)
